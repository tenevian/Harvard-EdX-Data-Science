# Harvard's Introduction to Data Science with Python (HarvardX PH526x)

## Overview
This repository contains materials and code for Harvard's "Introduction to Data Science with Python" course offered through EdX. The course focuses on using Python for data analysis, visualization, and basic machine learning concepts.

## Course Description
This course introduces students to the basics of data science through Python programming, covering essential libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. Students learn to work with data, create visualizations, and implement basic machine learning models.

## Course Structure

### 1. Linear Regression
- Basic concepts of linear regression
- Implementation using Python
- Error evaluation methods
- Model comparison techniques

### 2. Multiple and Polynomial Regression
- Working with multiple variables
- Understanding polynomial relationships
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model implementation and analysis

### 3. Model Selection and Cross-Validation
- Different validation techniques
- Model selection strategies
- Performance evaluation
- Cross-validation implementation

### 4. Bias, Variance, and Hyperparameters
- Understanding bias-variance tradeoff
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Model tuning strategies
- Validation approaches

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Key Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - Jupyter Notebook
